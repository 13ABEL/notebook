# my notebook

I code on most days since I'm working on my project (Relic), but I've been feeling discouraged lately since I haven't really been able to actually learn anything "new" and have been focused on building out features using the skills I already had. I started this notebook because I don't want to fall into the trap of being ok with what I already know.

I'm pushing myself to be consistent in learning new things which might or might not be related to Kotlin/Android and this is where I'm going to keep my notes/examples

I'll usually be updating this on weekend when I have larger blocks of time to just focus on learning. Notes will usually consist of reasons for approaching the topic, sources I read, and my thoughts about different approaches.
